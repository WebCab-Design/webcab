	<h3>Positive Image</h3>
	<p>A well built website by webCAB will help boost your company’s positive image by grabbing your customer’s attention with superior design that marries functionality and style.</p>

	<h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>
	<p>Companies who invest in good web design get a leg up on the competition. This is because customers can tell when they’re looking at a quality website or not. Our Web Design philosophy is to never underestimate the customer’s taste for good design.</p>

	<h3>Contact With Customers</h3>
	<p>Wouldn’t it be wonderful if you could greet every customer who was interested in your product or service personally? Short of shaking hands, a properly designed website will be the first friendly face your customers will encounter.
